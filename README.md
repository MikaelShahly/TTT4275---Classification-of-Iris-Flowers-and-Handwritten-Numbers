## Overview
This project, Classification of Iris Flowers and Handwritten Numbers, was developed as part of the coursework for TTK4275 - Estimation, Detection, and Classification at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). It was a collaborative group project aimed at implementing and analyzing various classification techniques to solve the Iris and MNIST classification tasks.

## Project Description
The project consists of two primary tasks:
Iris Task:
- Utilizing the Fisher Iris dataset, a linear classifier was developed to distinguish between three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
- The classifier's performance was evaluated based on different feature combinations and decision boundaries.

Handwritten Numbers Task:
- Using the MNIST dataset, classifiers based on nearest-neighbor (NN), k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), and k-means clustering were implemented to identify handwritten digits.
- Focus was placed on reducing computational complexity while maintaining classification accuracy.

## Instructions
To reproduce the results:
1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Install Python with required libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) for the Iris task.
3) Install MATLAB for the Handwritten Numbers task and load the provided dataset and scripts.
4) Run the scripts for each task to observe the classification process and results
